# JDA-Coursera-Notes

Before anything, 

**I would like to start by saying this is not a substitute for you to neglect Coursera contents:**
- You are still responsible for your own learning.
- This set of notes won't be covering all materials provided in Coursera. 
- Neither labs or quizzes will be mentioned in these notes. 


**The main goals/purposes of these notes include:**
- A general overview of some of the content I (Tom) found important.
- A gentle refreshment for once you've covered all materials in Coursera. 
- A feedback loop for everyone to either: criticize my work; add something I might've missed; suggest a better method of approaching "topics".


In addition, I'm by no mean a good note-taker nor do I convey my thoughts clearlyâ€” as you can see throughout our zoom experiences, I thank you all for being patient and kind. These notes are for me to further develop the following skills:
- Meeting deadlines.
- managing my time better. 
- learn how to take better notes not only for myself to understand but for others too. 
- learning new software such as OneNote, Google Drive and Github.
- Most importantly, interact with people and get out of my own head.


More specifically, I've decided to personally share my notes in hope of potentially evening out the playing field. Throughout my experiences and interactions thus far, I can't help to notice that some participants had their bachelor's and masters, their own start-up and collaborated with UN nations, meanwhile I'm just starting out in Tech and never had a single class in computer science. If someone feels similarly, and I'm able to alleviate a tiny bit of stress for just one person, that is enough for me. 

With everything said and done, I'm also one person with so many hours in a day. Whether that is attending appointments or having to send myself to the ER because of fear I'm going to do something I regret, I apologize in advance to those who are expecting my notes. 

P.S. If anyone whose willing to help me critique my notes before I release them, please let me know through Emails (tomho0508@gmail.com) or Phone (289) 689 8050.
